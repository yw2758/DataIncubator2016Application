The recommendation system is mainly based on 3 components: school community crime rate, motor collision rate and hospital convenience.
All of the data souce is public and easy to download.

The initiation behind this project is based on my own education experience. My family is fully devoted to my personal education and my parents really spent quite a long time gathering information about all schools in our city because they had to consider every aspects of a particular when it comes to deciding the best school for me. It's hare to dig out safty and healthcare information and issues about a school,however,despite the ranking or teachers' background of a particualr school is easy to follow up on government websites.
Therefore recently I came up with this idea to incorporate those things of my parent's concern and make it into a comprehensive shcool or university recommendaton system.

The total size of these data source is aroune 1.5GB, which is not too big to handle in R environment.
